# Day 1: Getting Ready to Learn Python
## Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
```
## Comments
### Single line comment:

For single line commant use #

### Multiline comment:
```
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
```

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

## Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
x=str(2)
print(type(x))
y='john'

```
