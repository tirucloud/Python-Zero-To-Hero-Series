# Day 1: Getting Ready to Learn Python
## Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 

## Comments
### single line comment:
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

### Multiline comment:
```
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
```
print("Cheers, Mate!")
